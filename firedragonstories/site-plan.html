      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>One of my favorite hobbies is reading fantasy or science fiction books. So I have always wanted to create a science fiction story, with that idea in mind I will create a webpage that will be like a blog/wiki of the story  I'm going to create. The main webpage will have the latest story updates and posts. The main page will also have a summary of what the story will be about, the main page will also include links to the character page which will give detailed information about the character; such as background story, the items weaponry he uses, and power levels they have. Other tabs that will be included in the main webpage will be Chapters in the story, Questions, and Answers, and Artwork.
        Some of the feedback that I got from friends was that it will maybe take more time to develop the story and characters than the website Others said that it was an interesting idea and that they might want to see it once the website is created. I got very positive feedback from them my only concern is maybe the time needed to create the story.  </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience for this website is all those who like to read or listen to science fiction stories like Lord of the Rings, Deltora Quest, The last Kindom, or have played D&D. My website will consist of me telling a story of how a group of new adventuring hero's start there Journey to explore the land of the lost land of the north. So my specific audience is aimed at the type of people who like stories about war, elves, and mystical creatures </p>  <!-- change this -->
